# Leukemia-Diagnostics
- This project is a small contribute by me for as part of the effort by AI in medical science studey group to create an optimal diagnosis for leukemia.

- This work is based on the following paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564039v1.full.pdf

- The dataset was origionaly obtained from: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61080958

- It is available on kaggle before and after merging classes: 
  - https://www.kaggle.com/rashasalim/blood-smear-images-for-aml-diagnosis 
  - https://www.kaggle.com/lsaa2014/single-cell-morphological-dataset-of-leukocytes

- I was successful to reach 94% accuracy after less than 4 hours training Using GPU on Kaggle. But I believe with more data we'll have a better distribution of classes (some of the classes had less samples than others by fairly large amount), we can have a much better accuracy in addition to training for extra hours, which something I couldn't do depending on my laptop GPU capabilities.

- Also better fine tunning could also result in a btter training whic is something I encourage you all to do.

- Please feel free to use this work for it is a work of a beginner and enthusiast who is eager to  contribute implementing AI for good causes
- The project was implemented in Kaggle notebooks. So if you were planning to implement it else where you'll have to downlod the data and change the file patrh for the data loader directory.

- This work would not be completed without the contributions of:
